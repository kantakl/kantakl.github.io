            <p>In North American folklore, Bigfoot or Sasquatch are said to be hairy, 
              upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave 
              footprints. Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and 
              human ancestors or other great apes. They are strongly associated with the Pacific 
              Northwest (particularly Oregon, Washington and British Columbia), Northern California, 
              and individuals claim to see the creatures across North America. Over the years, these 
              creatures have inspired numerous commercial ventures and hoaxes.</p>

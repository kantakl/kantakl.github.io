            <p>"I had two squatches approach me after I had shot a deer in 2013...
              They were yelling back and forth making sounds I haven't heard in the woods in 35 yrs. 
              They sound like a mix of a bull, a bull elk and a lion. No animal makes sounds like
              that in Georgia." Jones County, Georgia. 11-05-2013.</p>

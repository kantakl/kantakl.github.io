            <p>In North American folklore, Bigfoot are said to be hairy, 
              upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave 
              footprints. Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and 
              human ancestors or other great apes. They are most commonly "seen" in the Summer
              and Fall months (see chart to the right). Over the years, these 
              creatures have inspired numerous commercial ventures and hoaxes. Explore the
            chart above to learn more about Bigfoot sightings over the past 50 years.</p>

              About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the Pacific Northwest, 
              with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America. Bigfoot has become 
              better known and a phenomenon in popular culture, and sightings have spread throughout North America. 
              Rural areas of the Great Lakes region and the Southeastern United States have been sources of numerous 
              reports of Bigfoot sightings, in addition to the Pacific Northwest.

            <p>In North American folklore, Bigfoot are said to be hairy, 
              upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave 
              footprints. Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and 
              human ancestors or other great apes. They are most commonly "seen" in the Summer
              and Fall months (see chart to the right). Over the years, these 
              creatures have inspired numerous commercial ventures and hoaxes.</p>

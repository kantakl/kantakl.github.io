            ESPN identified 10 categories, or skills, that go into athleticism, 
            and then asked eight panelists to assign a number from 1 to 10 to the 
            demands each sport makes of each of those 10 skills. By totalling and 
            averaging their responses, we arrived at a degree-of-difficulty number 
            for each sport on a 1 to 100 scale. That number places the difficulty of 
            performing each sport in context with the other sports we rated.

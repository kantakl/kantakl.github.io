        <h4>What is RuPaul's drag race? What is drag?! Drag is a type of entertainment where people dress up and perform, 
            often in highly stylized ways. RuPaul's Drag Race is a TV show that documents RuPaul in the search for 
            "America's next drag superstar." RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as 
            contestants are given different challenges each week.</h4>

            Welcome to the drag race, and start your engines! If you have never seen the show, there are a few basics
            you must know in order to understand this visualization. On Drag Race, contestants face challenges each week, and are
            then judged based on their performances. At the end of each week, RuPaul deems a winner, as well as a bottom two, who 
            then go on to lip-sync battle in order to prove to the judges that one of them deserves more to stay in the competition.
            Some tips for reading this chart: the x-axis plots the age of each contestant, and the y-axis plots
            the final finishing place. The radius of each circle represents number of challenges won throughout 
            the show (the larger the circle, the more challenges won), and the color gradient represents number 
            of lip sync battles (the darker the circle, the more lip sync battles).

            <p>Over the course of RPDR, contestants have applied from all across the USA
                with the hopes of being selected for the show. As you can see in the chart above,
                many of the contestants are from larger cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago), with
                much less representaion from less populated cities and regions. As you can see in this chart,
                the most popular regions that contestants hail from are the Northeast and the West, which contain
                two of the three largest cities in the USA.

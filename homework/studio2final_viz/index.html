        <h4>What is RuPaul's drag race? What is drag?! Drag is a type of entertainment where people dress up and perform, 
            often in highly stylized ways. Drag Race is a TV show that documents RuPaul in the search for 
            "America's next drag superstar." RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as 
            contestants are given different challenges each week.</h4>

            Some tips for reading this chart: the x-axis plots the age of each contestant, and the y-axis plots
            the final finishing place. The radius of each circle represents number of challenges won throughout the show 
            (the larger the circle, the more challenges won), and the color gradient represents number of lip sync battles
            (the darker the circle, the more lip sync battles).

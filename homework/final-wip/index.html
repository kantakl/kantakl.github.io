        <p>"I had two squatches approach me after I had shot a deer in 2013. 
          They didn't come into view but I wasn't trying to see as I was trying 
          to field dress my deer and leave the area. They were yelling back and 
          forth making sounds I haven't heard in the woods in 35 yrs. They sound 
          like a mix of a bull, a bull elk and a lion. No animal makes sounds like
          that in Georgia. I had also found many fresh tree breaks on my way to my 
          stand site the day before." Jones County, Georgia. 11-05-2013.</p>
